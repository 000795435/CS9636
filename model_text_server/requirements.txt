*** MUST USE JAVASCRIPT FOR THIS APPLICATION ***

Functionalities:

1) server must be able to receive and verify client credentials (Done)

2) server must be able to verify identity of clients sending messages (Done)
2a) if we have time (we probably don't), we can modify 2) to only verify whether the client
is a valid client for the application, but obfuscate the client's identity to the server
(client's identity will still be known to the receiver)

3) server must route and store private messages between clients (1 on 1 messaging) (Done)

4) server must be able to initialize and store group chat data for clients and send data to all connected
clients (initialize a group, store client IDs as contacts to the group; all members within the group should be able to access the set of connected IDs) (Done)

5) server must be able to store messages from group chats and have these messages delivered to all clients connected to the group chat. 
Messages should always be visible to members of the group, but only to members of the group. (Done)
5a) for testing the MLS implementation, there should be a function for the server to print messages from group chats (a backdoor)
 - 5a should be implemented later (when the SimpleMLS library is done)

6) server must be able to remove members from existing group chats when requested by client with the required permissions (Done)

7) server should make messages from a group chat inaccessible to members removed from the group (Done)
7a) for testing the MLS implementation, there should be a function for the client to attempt to infiltrate the group after being removed (a backdoor)
 - 7a should be implemented later (when the SimpleMLS library is done)

---- more requirements to be added when necessary ----
