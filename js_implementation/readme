Unique Username Generation:

Clients are assigned a unique 8-digit username when they connect to the server.
Direct Messaging (DM):

Clients can send private messages to each other using the /dm <username> <message> command.
The server routes and delivers the private messages only to the specified recipient.
Group Chat Creation:

A client can create a new group using the /create-group <groupName> command.
The client who creates the group becomes the admin of the group.
Only the admin can add or remove members from the group.
Group Membership:

Clients can request to join a group using the /join <groupName> command.
The admin of the group receives the join request and can approve by using /add-member <groupName> <username>.
Clients can be removed from the group by the admin using /remove-member <groupName> <username>.
Sending Group Messages:

Clients can send messages to a group using the /group-message <groupName> <message> command.
The server will only deliver messages to clients who are members of the group.
Clients who are not part of the group will not receive group messages.
Access Control (Admin Permissions):

Only the admin of a group has the permission to add or remove members.
Admin can also send messages and make decisions regarding membership.
Group Membership Validation:

When sending a group message, the server checks if the user is part of the group and only sends messages to valid members.
Users who are removed from a group will no longer receive messages from that group.
User Disconnect Handling:

When a user disconnects, they are removed from any group they were part of.
This ensures that users who disconnect no longer have access to any group messages.
